        <p [className]="'aboutText'">
            I'm currently working in Extia with the JAMSTACK technology. That includes ReactJS, gatsby and DatoCMS.
            That makes pages faster and is easier to manage the translations and add new content for the
            contributors.
        </p>
        <p [className]="'aboutText'">
            My knowledge is focused mainly on React, React Native, Redux for the state management, gatsby, Typescript,
            some angular and relational databases like MySQL or Postgres. Also I'd love to learn new technologies like
            Vue. On the backend side my knowledge is academic and focused on NodeJS and Express, PHP and some django.
        </p>
        <p [className]="'aboutText'">
            I'm quick learner and eager to improve my skills as a developer. I'm interested in constant learning as a
            frontend and backend developer.
